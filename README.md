# 📦 vue-composable-template

A simple and minimalistic setup for creating Vue 3 composables.

- 🧩 **TypeScript** by default
- 🌐 [**Vue 3 & Vite**](https://vitejs.dev) as a playground
- ✅ Testing using [**Vitest**](https://vitest.dev)
- 🛠 Building with [**unbuild**](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild)

## 💻 Development

The development is simple, you can find a sample composable in `./src/index.ts` where you can write your own composable, to start the playground you use `yarn dev`

## 📋 To-Do

- [ ] Edit package.json `name`, `description`, `repository` and `author`.
- [ ] Edit README.md.
- [ ] Develop your composable.
